# ninjax
`ninjax`: Nitro-speed inference of the nuclear equation of state with jax

`ninjax` will be designed to integrate with the following packages:

- `flowMC`: Bayesian inference accelerated by JAX and normalizing flows ([repo](https://github.com/kazewong/flowMC))
- `jim`: Bayesian inference of gravitational waves ([repo](https://github.com/kazewong/jim))
- `jose`: JAX-based TOV solver ([repo](https://github.com/tsunhopang/jose))
- `kim`/`grim`: Bayesian inference of kilonovae and GRBs (note: the name might be subject to change) **TO BE ADDED**
